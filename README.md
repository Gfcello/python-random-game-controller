### Achievements
This scripts has managed to die over 10 times on the first level and once on the second level.

### Behaviour
Chaos incarnate and a lot of unknown commands.

### Issues
This script may cause the game to close (if the character dies for example), so to be safe, having a text editing software open behind the game will prevent it typing cryptic messages to your loved ones.

This script runs on a pokemon emulator, the keys that are used are seen in the script and can be changed easily.

### Achievements
This script has managed to catch a shiny pidgey and after 9 hours, defeat the first gym leader.
