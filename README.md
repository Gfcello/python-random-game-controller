### Achievements
This scripts has managed to die over 10 times on the first level and once on the second level.

Chaos incarnate and a lot of unknown commands.

This script may cause the game to close (if the character dies for example), so to be safe, having a text editing software open behind the game will prevent it typing cryptic messages to your loved ones.

## Spelunky_AI
Script to play Spelunky.

### Achievements
This scripts has managed to beat the first level multiple times and get to the door of the second.

### Behaviour
